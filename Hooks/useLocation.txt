useLocation hook returns the location object that represents the current URL. Think of it as a useState which
returns a new location whenever the URL changes

import {useLocation} rom "react-router-dom"

const Index = () => {
    const location = useLocation()

    return (
        <div>
            <h1> Location: {location.pathname.replace("/", "") page}</h1>
            {location.pathname === "/about/dashboard" ? <p>This is your dashboard</p> : <p>Login to see dashboard</p>}
        </div>
        )
}

we created a var named "location" to store the URL path. 
location.pathname gives the URL of the current page you are viewing i.e www..../Login

.replace("what to replace", "new value") method replaces the "/" to '' bcoz we dont want the "/" to show in the 
URL name
